Get the cubs score in command line. Why? Why not?

Ok, so you are probably not a Cubs fan. Well, I have been all my life but I ran into a problem lately where people like to pry on my monitor. Believe me, I would love to pop the game on and watch it while in my cube. The next best thing, the scores in command line. Hey, now I can pop into a Linux terminal and type in the word cubs (because I added an alias in my .bash_profile pointing to the python script) that spits out the scores for me. 

If you see ways for my code to improve, don't be shy. Fix it. 

Ok, ok.. Edit the command being fed to subprocess and put your own team in. LOL
 

Go Cubs!
